# elpis Legacy Limited — Role, Onboarding and Administration Audit

**Method:** direct inspection of `migrations/*.sql`, `src/index.js`, all HTML pages and `assets/js/*`. Local D1 role rows and staff accounts were queried. No feature is marked implemented because an earlier plan mentioned it.

**Key finding:** there is **no Super Admin role** in the current implementation. The highest implemented role is **Managing Director**. The `permissions` and `role_permissions` tables exist but are not read by any API route; authorization is hardcoded by role name.

---

## 1. Actual role structure

| # | Role | Exists? | Separate? | Created by | Branch | Dashboard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Super Admin | **NO** | — | — | — | None |
| 2 | Managing Director | Yes | Yes | First account only through `POST /api/setup`; no later API can create another MD | Company-wide (`branch_id` null) | Role-aware `/dashboard.html` |
| 3 | Branch Manager | Yes | Yes | MD through `POST /api/staff`; no BM can create another BM | One branch | Branch-scoped dashboard |
| 4 | Team Lead | Yes | Yes | MD or own-branch BM through `POST /api/staff` | One branch; optional team membership/lead | Team-scoped dashboard |
| 5 | Marketer | Yes | Yes | MD or own-branch BM through `POST /api/staff` | One branch; optional team | Personal dashboard |
| 6 | Finance Officer | Yes | Yes | MD or own-branch BM through `POST /api/staff` | A branch field is stored, but finance access is company-wide | Finance dashboard |
| 7 | Client | Yes | Yes | Public `POST /api/signup`; staff `POST /api/clients` creates a client record without a portal login | Assigned branch | Client portal |

Source: `migrations/0001_auth_org.sql:98-103`, role checks in `src/index.js`, `assets/js/staff-shell.js`.

### 1.1 Super Admin vs Managing Director

- There is no Super Admin table row, role enum value, dashboard, permission bypass or seed account.
- `/api/setup` creates the first **Managing Director**, not a Super Admin.
- The MD has company-wide business access and can manage staff, branches, properties, clients, commissions and reports.
- The MD cannot create another MD through `/api/staff` or `/api/users`.
- System configuration is split across MD/Finance pages (`provider-config.html`, `finance-dashboard.html`) rather than a separate Super Admin console.
- Configurable role permissions are **not implemented**.

## 2. Account creation and approval matrix

| Account type | Who creates it today | Who approves it | Activation | Can create other accounts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| First Managing Director | Bootstrap caller with `X-Setup-Secret` at `POST /api/setup` | None; bootstrap secret is the only gate | Immediate | Yes, after login |
| Additional Managing Director | **No route** | — | — | — |
| Branch Manager | MD via staff-management UI or `POST /api/staff` | None | Immediate; no invitation | Can create TL, Marketer, Finance in own branch |
| Team Lead | MD or own-branch BM | None | Immediate | No |
| Marketer | MD or own-branch BM | None | Immediate | No |
| Finance Officer | MD or own-branch BM | None | Immediate | No |
| Client portal user | Public `POST /api/signup` | None | Immediate; status `Prospect` | No |
| Client record (no login) | MD/BM/TL/Marketer through `POST /api/clients` | None | Immediate; status set by creator | No |

### 2.1 Staff onboarding steps as implemented

1. MD/BM signs in at `login.html`.
2. Opens `staff-management.html`.
3. Clicks **Create staff account**.
4. Enters email, temporary password, full name, role, branch, phone, job title, date joined, optional team and notes.
5. Submits `POST /api/staff`.
6. The account is inserted directly into `users` with `is_active=1`.
7. A `staff_profiles` row is written.
8. Optional team membership is inserted.
9. An audit record `staff.create` is written.
10. The new staff member signs in with the password supplied out-of-band.

There is **no invitation email**, **no pending state**, **no staff approval queue**, **no email verification** and **no forced first-login password reset** (`must_reset_password` is unused).

### 2.2 Direct answers

- **Who creates a Branch Manager today?** Only a Managing Director, through `POST /api/staff` or the staff-management page.
- **Can a Branch Manager create Marketer accounts?** Yes, in their own branch.
- **Can a Branch Manager create Team Leads?** Yes, in their own branch.
- **Can a Marketer register independently?** No. There is no public staff application route.
- **Can a prospective employee apply for an account?** No.
- **Does anyone approve these applications?** There are no applications and no approval workflow. Accounts are active immediately.
- **Can the MD assign a staff member to another branch?** Yes, through `PUT /api/staff/:id`; the MD may select another branch.
- **Can a Super Admin override role and branch assignments?** There is no Super Admin. The MD is the highest override role.
- **What happens when an employee leaves?** MD/BM uses `POST /api/staff/:id/status` with `active:false`. Sessions are deleted, the account is marked inactive and records are retained. There is no delete/anonymisation workflow. The last active MD cannot be deactivated.

### 2.3 Client onboarding steps as implemented

1. Client opens `signup.html`.
2. Enters full name, email, phone, optional property and password.
3. `POST /api/signup` checks duplicate email/phone and rate limits attempts.
4. A Client user and a Prospect client record are created in Head Office.
5. An assignment to the first active MD is recorded.
6. A welcome notification and session are created.
7. Staff later assign branch, marketer and team lead through `POST /api/clients/:id/assign` (UI exists on client detail only for status/notes, not assignment controls).

Clients cannot choose role, branch, marketer, team lead, contract price or status.

## 3. Permission configuration

### Current state

- Roles are hardcoded strings in `src/index.js`.
- Access is enforced in Worker APIs, not only by hiding menus.
- `permissions` and `role_permissions` exist in migration `0001`, but no route reads them.
- There is no permission-matrix UI.
- No Super Admin can toggle view/create/edit/delete/approve/reject/assign/export/download/configure per role.

### Required design if configurable permissions are adopted

A configurable matrix must be a **ceiling**, not a grant. Example mandatory boundaries:

- Marketer personal records only; never company-wide finance.
- BM branch only; never another branch.
- Finance no staff role administration.
- Client own records only.
- Only MD/authorised finance can verify/refund/adjust payments.
- Only MD/BM can establish contract prices.
- Only MD/authorised finance can approve/pay commissions.

Enabling a menu item must never bypass these API constraints.

**Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED.**

---

## 5. Notifications and internal communication

### Implemented

- Client notifications table and endpoints:
  - `GET /api/client/notifications`

### Not implemented

- No staff notification inbox endpoint or page. Staff notifications are written to `notifications` with `user_id`, but no staff API reads them.
- No meeting notifications.
- No staff-to-staff chat or direct messages.
- No chat tables, routes, UI, moderation, attachments or read receipts.
- Email/WhatsApp delivery adapters are placeholders only.

**Recommendation:** treat staff notifications and internal chat as a separate Phase 9 module after the owner approves the policy (who can message whom, retention, moderation, attachments and notification channels).

## 7. Performance metrics actually used

| Metric | Calculation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Contract sales value | Sum of `clients.agreed_purchase_price` in scope | Contract value, not cash |
| Verified collections | Sum of `payments.amount_kobo` where `status='verified'`, `is_demo=0`, `currency='NGN'` | Actual verified cash |
| Outstanding | `max(0, contract - verified)` | Refunds/reversals reduce verified |
| Marketer ranking | Sort by verified collections desc, then contract value | Uses `original_marketer_id` or `created_by` |
| Team ranking | Sort by verified collections desc, then contract value | Uses team lead or team members |
| Lead conversion | `converted leads / total leads × 100`, one decimal | Scope-specific |
| Branch comparison | Client/contract/verified/outstanding by branch | Category filter supported |
| Customer performance ranking | **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | — |

### Important business-rule note

Client visibility and commission attribution use the **current** relationship-manager assignment after Phase 7. Marketer performance rankings still use **original** marketer/creator attribution. This means a reassigned client can disappear from the old marketer's client list while still contributing to the old marketer's ranking. The owner should decide which rule is correct before production.

## 8. Local test accounts

Local accounts already exist and were not duplicated. Seed scripts now generate a fresh random password per account at run time and print it once; only the hash is stored.

See the final response for the local URLs and credentials. Do not reuse these passwords in production.

| Role | Local account |
|---|---|
| Managing Director | `md@elpisproperty.test` |
| Branch Manager (Ikeja) | `bm.ikeja@elpisproperty.test` |
| Branch Manager (Ajah) | `bm.ajah@elpisproperty.test` |
| Team Lead (Ikeja) | `tl.ikeja@elpisproperty.test` |
| Team Lead (Ajah) | `tl.ajah@elpisproperty.test` |
| Marketer | `mkt.ikeja@elpisproperty.test`, `mkt.ikeja2@elpisproperty.test`, `mkt.ajah@elpisproperty.test` |
| Finance Officer | `finance@elpisproperty.test` |
| Client | `ada@example.com` |

**Super Admin:** no account exists because the role does not exist.

## 9. Prioritised recommendations

1. **Decide the Super Admin policy.** Create a true system role only if it will be separate from MD; otherwise rename the expectation to “MD system administration”.
2. **Add staff onboarding states.** Invitation, pending approval, approved, active, suspended. Add approvals, email verification and forced first-login reset.
3. **Build a permission matrix as a ceiling.** Keep mandatory API boundaries.
4. **Add staff notifications and internal chat.** Separate from client notifications; define retention and moderation.
5. **Add team-performance and customer-performance reports.**
6. **Add client transaction and outstanding-balance statement PDFs.**
7. **Resolve marketer ranking attribution.** Current assignment vs original attribution must be an explicit policy.
8. **Add customer-ranking metric configuration** if “best customer” is required.
9. **Add email/WhatsApp adapters** and verify provider credentials.
10. **Replace demo passwords, provision production secrets and run a staging penetration test.**
