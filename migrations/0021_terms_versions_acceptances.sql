1. Account information
You confirm that the information you provide during registration is accurate, current and complete. You must promptly update your contact details if they change.

2. Identity verification
You consent to identity and KYC checks, including verification of the identity details and BVN you provide. Identity numbers and BVNs are handled securely and are never displayed in full.

Payments must be made through the verified channels shown in your client portal. A dedicated virtual account may be created with our banking partner. You are responsible for confirming the account details before sending money.
