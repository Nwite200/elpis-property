# elpis Legacy Limited — Phase 8 Final Integration Audit

**Status:** local audit and hardening complete. The later explicit owner instruction authorized a live demo deployment; the demo is deployed at `https://ELPIS_STAGING_WORKER_HOST` with temporary demo accounts. The Phase 8 code changes remain uncommitted at the time of writing.

**Audit date:** 04 November 2026

---

## 1. Scope and constraints

Phase 8 was executed against the existing Cloudflare-only architecture:

- Cloudflare Workers (`src/index.js`)
- Workers Static Assets (28 HTML pages, CSS and JavaScript)
- Cloudflare D1 (`DB`, local `elpis-legacy-db`)
- Cloudflare R2 (`FILES`, local bucket)
- Cloudflare KV (`CACHE`, declared but not yet used)
- Cloudflare Queues (`TASKS`, local interface only)
- Wrangler (`wrangler.toml`, local state under `.wrangler/`)

No framework migration, no replacement backend and no production resource was introduced. Existing Phase 1–7 behaviour was preserved.

> Note on Git: the Phase 7 work referenced as “currently uncommitted” in the Phase 8 brief was committed and pushed under the previous explicit Phase 7 authorization (`34f6be8`). The Phase 8 working tree was uncommitted until the later explicit owner instruction authorized a final GitHub push. No Phase 7 or Phase 8 history was rewritten.

## 2. Integration fixes completed

### 2.1 Broken authentication guards

Four staff pages called `/api/api/me` because a local helper already prefixed `/api`:

- `assets/js/clients.js`
- `assets/js/properties.js`
- `assets/js/property-create.js`
- `assets/js/client-register.js`

They now call `/api/me` correctly. The affected pages load for authenticated staff instead of redirecting to login.

### 2.2 Public enquiry capture

The homepage and property-detail enquiry forms previously simulated success with `setTimeout` and never persisted anything.

- Added `POST /api/public/enquiries`.
- Validates name, phone, email, message length and optional property/branch.
- Resolves a published property and branch where supplied.
- Creates a real `leads` record in `New Lead` status with **no self-assigned marketer/team lead** and **no contract price**.
- Applies IP rate limiting through the audit log.
- Both public forms now submit to the real endpoint and show a controlled error on failure.

### 2.3 Property media and document management

The `property_documents` table existed but had no upload, download or delete path.

Added:

- `POST /api/properties/:id/documents` — private R2 upload, PDF/JPEG/PNG, 10MB maximum, magic-byte verification.
- `GET /api/properties/:id/documents/:docId/download` — authenticated staff download, branch scoped, attachment disposition, `private, no-store`.
- `DELETE /api/properties/:id/documents/:docId` — R2 and D1 deletion with audit.
- Property detail page UI for image upload/delete and private document upload/download/delete.
- Image upload now verifies magic bytes, not only the browser-declared MIME type.
- Unpublished property images require staff authorization and are served with `private, no-store`.
- `/api/files/*` still rejects receipts, reports and property documents.

### 2.4 Client detail workflow

- Wired the existing “Add note” UI to `POST /api/clients/:id/notes`.
- Status updates now report API failure instead of reloading silently.
- Client detail portfolio and notes output is HTML-escaped.
- Client dashboard portfolio, notifications and payment messages are HTML-escaped.

### 2.5 Other integration repairs

- Public “Client Login” links now target `client-login.html`.
- Live homepage property cards now use numeric D1 IDs and `property.html` loads live D1 properties when not in the static catalogue.
- `leads.html?lead=<id>` now opens the linked lead.
- `/api/properties` honours `is_published` and clamps pagination.
- Team Lead and Marketer user-directory requests are branch-scoped; Finance Officer marketer filters now use the authorised user directory.
- Sales, collections and outstanding report datasets now apply marketer and team filters.
- Shared `assets/js/mobile-nav.js` was added to every HTML page. It provides a drawer toggle for static staff pages and client portal pages that previously hid their sidebar on mobile without a replacement.
- Tables were wrapped in scroll containers where needed.
- Client dashboard KPI cards collapse to one column on small screens.

## 3. Security hardening completed

- Top-level request error handling: malformed JSON returns a controlled JSON `400`; unexpected failures return generic JSON `500` without stack traces.
- `Sec-Fetch-Site` is checked in addition to `Origin`/`Host`.
- Login rotates away any prior browser session (session-fixation mitigation).
- Public signup and password-reset requests are rate-limited through audit records.
- Property image/document uploads validate MIME declaration **and** file signature.
- Private R2 prefixes are explicitly checked before download.
- Receipt R2 keys must start with `receipts/`; commission receipts must start with `commission-receipts/`.
- Unpublished property images no longer receive public cache headers.
- Property criteria/quote handling was checked for parameter binding; dynamic SQL uses bound parameters, not interpolated user input.
- Inline financial transaction actions were converted from string-interpolated `onclick` handlers to data attributes and event listeners.
- Client-facing HTML rendering of database-controlled names, descriptions and notes was escaped in the repaired views.

## 4. Financial integrity verification

The existing integer-kobo ledger and Phase 7 commission model were re-run through the full regression suites.

Verified by tests:

- Only `status='verified'`, non-demo, NGN payments count as collections.
- Pending, failed, reversed and refunded transactions do not remain in verified totals.
- Demo payments and demo contracts are excluded from live reports.
- Contract prices remain integer kobo and authoritative.
- Refunds/reversals create traceable adjustments without overwriting the original payment or commission entry.
- Commission generation is idempotent.
- Duplicate commission payments are prevented by idempotency keys.
- Approval, rejection, self-approval prevention, partial payment and final payment remain enforced.
- Commission earned/approved/paid/outstanding totals reconcile with `commission_entries`.
- Marketer and Branch Manager scopes remain current-assignment/branch based; the Phase 7 reassignment regression still passes.

No automatic bank payout or invented ALAT/Wema endpoint was added.

---

## 5. Database and migration audit

- Nine migrations exist: `0001`–`0009`.
- All nine were applied in order to a fresh SQLite database inside the Phase 8 suite.
- The fresh database passed `PRAGMA integrity_check` and `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`.
- The working test database also passed both checks.
- The local Wrangler database reports no pending migrations.
- Foreign keys are enforced by the test harness.
- New property-document and image paths use existing schema; no new migration was required.
- `client_properties` remains the multi-property allocation table.

---

## 6. Responsive and visual audit

A headless Chrome session (Chrome 156) was run against local `wrangler dev` at:

- Desktop: 1440 × 900
- Tablet: 768 × 1024
- Mobile: 390 × 844

Twenty-five pages were rendered per viewport (75 renders), including public pages, all staff dashboards and all client portal pages. Every page reported `documentElement.scrollWidth` equal to the layout viewport with no document-level horizontal overflow. Screenshots were captured for the landing page, staff dashboard, client dashboard and property detail page at desktop and mobile sizes.

The only console message observed was a single missing static resource (favicon); no page-level JavaScript exception was reported.

## 7. Test results

| Suite | Passed | Failed | Skipped |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Phase 5 regression/security | 62 | 0 | 0 |
| Phase 6 dashboards/analytics | 21 | 0 | 0 |
| Phase 7 commissions/reports/portfolio | 26 | 0 | 0 |
| Phase 8 integration/security | 36 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **145** | **0** | **0** |

Phase 8 tests cover authentication cookies/session fixation, CSRF/fetch metadata, malformed JSON, public enquiries, signup/enquiry rate limits, property document upload/download/delete, private R2 isolation, cross-branch document denial, magic-byte rejection, unpublished image gating, report filters, role isolation, frontend integration checks, landing catalogue and clean-migration reproducibility.

Syntax checks passed for `src/index.js`, every `assets/js/*.js` file, every test suite and every inline HTML script. `git diff --check` is clean.

---

## 8. Remaining production dependencies

The application is deployed to a **live Cloudflare demo** at `https://ELPIS_STAGING_WORKER_HOST`. It is not yet a fully signed-off production service. Remaining external and infrastructure dependencies are listed in `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` and `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`, including:

- Real Cloudflare D1/R2/KV/Queue resource IDs.
- Production secrets and custom domain/DNS.
- ALAT by Wema business API credentials and provider documentation.
- Email and WhatsApp provider adapters.
- Email verification, CAPTCHA and/or an edge rate-limiting service for public signup.
- Real PDF/e-signature document workflows if required by the business.

## 9. Verdict

**READY FOR CONTROLLED DEMO / STAGING ACCEPTANCE.**

Evidence: all 145 local tests pass, the migration chain is reproducible, critical integration defects were repaired, private files are access-controlled, 75 responsive renders show no document-level horizontal overflow, and a live Cloudflare demo is running with temporary role accounts. Super Admin, permission-guarded admin routes, staff notifications, Durable Object chat and hierarchical revenue drill-down are implemented. Full production sign-off still requires the external provider credentials, security headers, monitoring, backup validation, custom domain and owner acceptance listed in the readiness checklist. Staff onboarding approvals and permanent ALATPay static wallets remain outstanding.
